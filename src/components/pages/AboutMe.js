        My name is Tai Disla, I am a New York City native with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Urban Studies (with a focus in Design & Planning) and Minor in Art from San Diego State University.

        I am meticulously detail oriented and aspire to create and design functional spaces. I also love to learn and am constantly looking for ways to up my game: learning new programs, practicing coding, keeping up to date with design trends and new tech, reading self-help books as well as listening to podcast.

        In my free time you will most likely find me exploring taking photos. Photography is something I have been doing since a kid and is a true passion of mine, my happy place is traveling and taking pictures. I also love to hangout with my little brother, visit galleries and museums, be in nature and generally getting lost in a new place.

        I am open to new opportunities both within Design & Architecture as well as within technology.
